ludum_dare_2013_4_darwinism
===========================

My hacky ludum dare game Darwinism, of which theme is 'You only have one'. You only have one minute to evolve through as many generations as possible.

Arrow keys or WASD keys. Eat fish for evolution points, force an evolution once past halfway with SPACE.

Started from scratch using Phaser over 3 days of moderate hacking. Really not exemplary code in any sense.
